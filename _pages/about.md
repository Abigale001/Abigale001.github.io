I am currently a third-year PhD student of Data Science and Machine Intelligence ([DSMI](http://dsmi.tech/)) Lab of Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, under the supervision of [Prof. Guandong Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/guandong-xu), [Dr. Hongxu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/hxchen) and [Dr. Xiangguo Sun](https://xiangguosun.mystrikingly.com/). Now I am a visiting student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the collaborative supervisors are [Dr. Yu Yang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/dr-yang-yu/) and [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/).

I have obtained my Master's degree from National University of Defense Technology in Dec, 2019. The supervisor were Prof. Dongsheng Li and A/Prof. Dawei Feng.

My current research is focusing on explainable machine learning, especially the application in the recommendation area. The planning thesis title is Towards Graph-based Explainable Recommender Systems.
- Explainability
- Recommender systems
- Causal learning
- Graph neural networks
- Natural language processing
